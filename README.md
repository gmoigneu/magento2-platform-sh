# Magento 2 CE on Platform.sh

This repo provides a starting point for setting up a Magento 2 project on Platform.sh.

## Problem

Most applications require some database connection.  Since part of the point of Platform.sh is that each environment/branch of your project gets its own unique resources, it wouldn't make sense to hardcode the credentials to those resources.  You might be on `branch_foo` and connecting to `master` branch's database, which would be a Bad Thing.  Each environment therefore has it's resources/services encoded into Linux environment variables.  At runtime you pull those credentials out of the environment variables and then build the database/redis/solr/whatever connection string from that.

Every other PHP framework that I know of uses a php file to perform its configuration for stuff like this.  This makes it super simple to pull the connection info out of those environment variables.  The one notable exception that I know of is Magento, which uses an XML file to store its configuration.

This presents a problem for Platform.sh.

## Solution

This set of code dynamically genreates the XML config and places it where it needs to go (app/etc/...).  

## Setup

This repo assumes that your Magento codebase is stored in the `web` directory of this repo, so if that's not ok with you you're going to have to reverse some of this code, namely the `web.locations` block in app.yaml and the file paths in `Platform.php`, pay attn to anything with the `Platformsh::webRoot` property in it, ie search the file for `$webRoot` and adjust the file paths accordingly.  

I advise you to step through the `Platform.php` file to get a sense of what's what.

## Composer stuff

Since the Magento 2 download comes with the `vendor` folder already populated with the needed Composer packages you don't need to deal with running `composer install` locally.  They also, however, included the `vendor` folder in the `.gitignore`, which means that when you check your project into Git and push it to Platform.sh, none of your Composer dependencies are there.

This is where our new [Authenticated Composer repositories](https://docs.platform.sh/tutorials/composer-auth.html#authenticated-composer-repositories) feature earns its bacon.  Please read that link for greater understanding.

You'll need to have a Magento account, and then follow [this guide](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) to get your credentials for the Magento Composer repo.

The [`hooks.build`](https://github.com/JGrubb/magento2-platform-sh/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml#L51-L57) command present in this repo's `.platform.app.yaml` assumes that you will place your credentials into environment variables named  `magento_user` and `magento_pass`, but feel free to name them whatever and alter the build hook accordingly.

After all this, everything should Just Work.
